Note I am using Shared prefrences to store the location data on my app
This app will work for android version below 7.0 
reason is a bug as from android version 7.0 the android requires more verification to store files 
as the time to submit this project is about to get over i cant correct it now
********************************************************************************************************
All the 3 features are workin that are expected from the app
1.It will give the deatils for user location i set it to upadate value every second to test this feature
2.When a person move from his/her location it got a screen asking if he/she is ggoing to meet someone and is he/she using any vehicles
user have to enter name of friend and the vehicle used to travel to his/her friend if any 
3. you can see the data in last portion of homescreen 
Note:This app will work in Android version below 7.0 only at 7.0 and abouve it will not work
